# 🌿Build a Lens Protocol App using scaffold eth!

This scaffold is a quick start template of a lens protocol app, built using next.js and tailwind css. It uses the api calls and graph queries to create the entire app.

# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH + ▲ Next.js

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abasedape/Lens-QuickStart.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd Lens-QuickStart
yarn deploy
```

> in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
